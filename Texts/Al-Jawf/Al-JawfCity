Al-Jawf
Al-Jawf was the core area of one of the most ancient of the South Arabian kingdoms, the state of Maʿīn (c. 1000 BCE–2nd century BCE). From their capital, Qarnaw, the Minaeans of Maʿīn ruled over large sections of the southern Arabian Peninsula. The oases ofAl-Jawf were a fertile and densely populated area, with many towns. After the conquest of Yemen by the Abbasids in the 9th century CE, however, the power centres of Yemeni civilization moved to the west, and the region was neglected.
